# Laravel Nova Example Projects

[Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) is great, no question about it. But of course it's not impossible to come
across requirements that Nova doesn't cover by default.

There are a large number of community packages. But do you want to use a large number of packages all the time and be
dependent on them being maintained?

Laravel and Laravel Nova offer the necessary built-in functionality to realise desired adaptations without installing a
community package.

Various projects are implemented in this repository and an attempt is made to manage without or with as few additional
packages as possible.
